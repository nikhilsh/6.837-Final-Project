##### A realistic boat simulation in Unity

In this final project for 50.017 Graphics and Visualisation project, our group aims to build a computationally efficient simulation of objects in wate 
suitable for video games and real time interactions. There are many models of implementation of fluids in computer graphics and one of the more common methods
of implementation are physics based. One example of such implementation is the Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (Monaghan, 2005). However, such model of
implementations are complex to implement, computationally heavy and requires optimising data structures for real time and realistic graphical simulations. In our model of boat simulation, we aim to use a simplified model to create real time and passable interaction between objects and water suitable for video games and rapid prototyping.
